Parameters:
Ki - rate of S -> E (Time varying, uses stepwiseTimeSeries in the code to convert knot and value pairs into a vector of ndays)

Kasymp - Numerator is the % of E -> A (as opposed to E -> P); Denominator is the number of days for one to progress from Exposed to Infectious.
Kpres - Numerator is the % of E -> P (as opposed to E -> A); Denominator is the number of days for one to progress from Exposed to Infectious.
Typically, 1 - Kasymp = Kpres

Kmild - Numerator is the % of P -> Sm (as opposed to E -> Ss); Denominator is the number of days for one to progress from Presymptomatic to Symptomatic.
Kseve - Numerator is the % of P -> Ss (as opposed to E -> Sm); Denominator is the number of days for one to progress from Presymptomatic to Symptomatic.
Typically, 1 - Kmild = Kseve

Khosp - 1/(Mean number of day from Ss to H)
Kcrit - 1/(Mean number of day from H to C)
Kdeath - 1/(Mean number of day from C to D)

Krec_asym - 1/(Mean number of day from A to R) (Time varying)
Krec_symm - 1/(Mean number of day from Sm to R) (Time varying)
Krec_crit - 1/(Mean number of day from C to Hpc) (Time varying)
Krec_hpc - 1/(Mean number of day from Hpc to R) (Time varying)
Krec_hosp - 1/(Mean number of day from H to R) (Time varying)

Pcrit - P(Critical inclusive of Death | H)
Pdeath - P(Death | Critical)

Pdet_* - Detection probability at * stage (All time varying)
Detection probability of asymptomatic and presymptomatic is assumed to be 1/6 of Pdet_symm

frac_infectiousness_As - How infectious are asymptomatic wrt symptomatic people
frac_infectiousness_det - How infectious are detection infection wrt undetected

time_to_detect - vector, mean day to detection for Asymptomatic, Symptomatic mild and Symptomatic severe stages.

Model support multiple nodes that can mix with each other. Model is fitted using an event-driven algorithm, which allows specification of non exponential movement between compartment. However, we only assume exponential movement here, so this model is no different from fitting using a Gillespie method.
